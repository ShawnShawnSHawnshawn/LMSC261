Africa - D'Angelo
Africa is my descent
And here I am, far from home
I dwell within a land that is meant
Meant for many men not my tone, yeah
The blood of God is my defense
Let it drop down to my seed
Showers to your innocence
To protect you for all eternity
And with this wood, I beat this drum
We won't see defeat, yeah
From kings to queens becomes a prince
Knowledge and wisdom is understanding what we need
Ever since the day you came
My whole world began to change
I knew then to dedicate my life
For your own (and this day will come)
Everyday, I see you grow
And remember what you already know
I receive, I receive the love
That radiates from your glow
From which you came was love
And that's how it all should be
You and my soul are one
Through all the time and history, yeah
Thank you, thank you
